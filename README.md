# StyleBank

A complete(almost) PyTorch Implementation of *StyleBank: An Explicit Representation for Neural Image Style Transfer*

The dataset is COCO_2017val(my computer's hard disk space is not enough for a lager dataset), I chose the first 1000 pictures from this dataset for training.

And you can see some result in *generate_image* folder, the codes is in *codes*

QZQTechMonster gave me this great help in this experiment.
